# The Texture needs to contain the buttons in that oder going from left to right
# With the top row containing the texture for unpressed buttons and the bottom
# row for pressed buttons. The plugin calculates a 3px gap between all textures 
# and 1 px border around the entire texture
# After the amount of buttons specified in texture_w the plugin will stop searching
# for textures to the right and start in the next row
